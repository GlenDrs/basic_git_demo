When we create a new branche that we will do a pull request to the github for the sake of the 
merge into Dev branche it is a commun rule to use the prefix 'Feature/' when we start working
to this branch, example: Feature/makint_administrator. And we use the prefix 'fix/ when' we come
back to this branch for the sake of fixing something, example: fix/add_option_to_admin.

As showed in demo file (line 38) we use the 'git checkout -d' line to create the new branche.
Example: git checkout -b Feature/an_example_branche
