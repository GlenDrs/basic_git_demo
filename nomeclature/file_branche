In github we have the main or master branche. In paralel of that we'll create the branche Developpement (or 'Dev').
all the other branches wi'll be merget to the Dev after thei'r pull request. and in the end before production the Dev will merge to master (or main) branche. 

When we create a new branche that we will do a pull request to the github for the sake of the 
merge into Dev branche it is a commun rule to use the prefix 'Feature/' when we start working
to this branch, example: Feature/makint_administrator. And we use the prefix 'fix/ when' we come
back to this branch for the sake of fixing something, example: fix/add_option_to_admin.

As showed in demo file (line 38) we use the 'git checkout -d' line to create the new branche.
Example: git checkout -b Feature/an_example_branche
