# In this part we well explain the commands that we use to go back in our work. 
# we will have four cases:
a: going back to our work when we haven't committed.
b: going back to our changes after we've already committed.
c: going back to our changes without committing automatically.
d: resetting => invalidatting all the 'coming backs' and go return at the stad of the app before we went back.

* To show the work we will print further some lines with the number of the commits (we will commit after each 
* line except the last one), the first one will be ne level 0, the next lines will print each one the number of
* the commit. The last line will not be committed.

p "Commit level 0, there will be no revert untill here "
p "Commit level 1, no changes untill here"
p "Commit level 2, after the level 3 we will add but we'll not commit. the
  line will be simply called No commit level 4"
p "Commit level 3, after this level we'll add without committing. the line will be simply called No commit level 4
